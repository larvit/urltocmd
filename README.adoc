= URL to Command

Run a command on a server based on an URL

== Options

Takes environment variables:

* PORT - defaults to 3000

== How to run

The command takes a JSON as input and executes a web server based on the content.

The JSON must be structured as follows:

[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"url": "/some-url",
		"cmd": "command to be ran on the server"
	},
	{
		"url": "/some-other-url",
		"cmd": "Another command to be ran on the server"
	}
]
----

For example, it can be ran like this:

`echo '[{"url":"/some-url","cmd":"do something"}]' | npm start`

Or from a file:

`cat urlsAndCmds.json | npm start`

=== Via docker

(Does not work, PRs or other fix welcomed)

Build the image: `docker build -t urltocmd .`
Run: `cat urlsAndCmds.json | docker run --rm -t urltocmd`
