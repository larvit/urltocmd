= URL to Command

Run a command on a server based on an URL

== Options

Takes environment variables:

=== PORT

*defaults to 3000*

=== LOGFILE

Set to have the log written to this path in addition to stdout

=== Using .env file

For simplicity, add these to the .env file. Like this:

..env
----
PORT=5400
LOGFILE=/var/log/urltocmd.log
----

== How to run

The command takes a JSON as input and executes a web server based on the content.

The JSON must be structured as follows:

[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"url": "/some-url",
		"cmd": "command to be ran on the server"
	},
	{
		"url": "/some-other-url",
		"cmd": "Another command to be ran on the server"
	}
]
----

For example, it can be ran like this:

`echo '[{"url":"/some-url","cmd":"do something"}]' | npm start`

Or from a file:

`cat urlsAndCmds.json | npm start`
